# Road-Lane-Detection-System

Image Processing project developed to assist drivers using camera data, the designed software led to a decrease in time and space complexities of the conventional methods to the same approach.

The proposed system does not require any extra information such as lane width and time to lane crossing. Concepts such as Hough Transform, Gaussian Blur, Bitwise AND, grayscale image of Image Processing used.

Software designed in python, numpy and matplotlib libraries are used.
